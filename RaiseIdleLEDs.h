/*
 * NOTE: This plugin is a workaround, do not use it for anything but the Dygma
 * Raise!
 *
 * The single reason this exists is because the firmware the first Raises will
 * ship with have a variant of IdleLEDs that stores its settings in EEPROM, but
 * the plugin is at the end of the plugin list. Kaleidoscope has
 * PersistentIdleLEDs, which does the same thing. The problem is, that we need
 * to move IdleLEDs to the top of the list, so it can catch all key events
 * before they get consumed by other plugins, but that would rearrange the
 * EEPROM layout. Since we want to remain compatible with the initial version of
 * the factory firmware, we can't do that.
 *
 * So this plugin is here as a workaround: we keep PersistentIdleLEDs at the
 * same position the old IdleLEDs plugin was, but we add this plugin at the top.
 * All it does, is catch key events and proxy them to PersistentIdleLEDs, thus
 * making sure it sees everything. It does mean that PersistentIdleLEDs will act
 * twice on most key presses, but thankfully, that has no ill side effects. At
 * most, we'll set the start time twice, but that's a very cheap operation.
